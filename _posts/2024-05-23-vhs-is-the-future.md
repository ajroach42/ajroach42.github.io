title: VHS Is The Future
---
I run a video store here in Ellijay called [Cowabunga Video](https://cowabungavideo.com). We do sales and rental for used VHS, DVD, Bluray, etc. out of [Mountain Town Antiques](https://mountaintownantiques.com), and we sell [new movies on VHS, DVD, and bluray through Hemlock Bazaar](https://www.hemlockbazaar.com/product-category/movies/) online and in store. We're in the process of shooting a new show in partnership with [New Ellijay Television](https://newellijay.tv) called VHS IS THE FUTURE. Check out the teaser trailer:

The show will debut in July, and will cover indie VHS, DVD, and Bluray releases, as well as small television shows and web series. It should be a real party, and I'm super excited about it. 

If you want to get in on the action ahead of time, you can check the [Cowabunga Video section of the Hemlock Bazaar blog](https://www.hemlockbazaar.com/tag/cowabunga/), where we write about recent releases across many formats. New posts go up every week!
