We've re-captured this previously unavailable episode of Flash Gordon, you can watch it here looking better than ever.

In [my last post on Flash Gordon](http://ajroach42.com/flash-gordon-1954/) I said: 

> This episode, more than most film we’ve captured recently, highlights some of the problems that our current transfer method encounters. I have recently ordered a new Telecine, and this will be the first film to run through our new transfer equipment when that arrives in a few weeks. When that’s done, I’ll post a comparison, and maybe a walkthrough of the two pieces of equipment.

And I did. The [video comparison is on peertube](https://mountaintown.video/videos/watch/7df35356-a236-416b-920d-c71dbcc0a253) and archive.org, and the new transfer is embedded above (and will be [on archive.org this weekend](https://archive.org/details/@ajroach42).) 

I'm uploading our TV and film transfers to peertube, with [1 week of early access for patrons on Patreon.](https://patreon.com/ajroach42), after which they'll be public on patreon and on peertube. Once a month or so, I upload everything we've digitized so far to [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/@ajroach42).
