  The Loose Ends of Act One - Michael Cera Palin - Vinyl reissue pre-orders from
  Analog Revolution
---
I'm super excited to announce that my record label, [Analog Revolution, will be releasing Micahel Cera Palin's The Loose Ends of Act One on vinyl, shipping in Q2 2024](https://analogrevolution.com/product/michael-cera-palin-the-loose-ends-of-act-1-vinyl-pre-order/). I've been friends with the folks in Michael Cera Palin for longer than any of us would care to admit, they played the grand openning of our makerspace, and I am just incredibly proud of the body of work they have developed, and to have the opportunity to help bring it in to the world. 

If you canâ€™t wait for the vinyl release, sign up for [cassettesfor.me](https://cassettesfor.me/the-loose-ends-of-act-1-from-michael-cera-palin-for-december-cassettes-for-me-release/) by December 15th to claim your CFM exclusive MCP cassette or CD! This will be a limited run of 50 cassettes and 50 CDs, so once we are out, we are out!

Preview it here:

When I opened [Analog Revolution](https://analogrevolution.com) with my friend [Ryan Stoyer](https://www.bonsabitea.com/) a little more than 10 years ago, I hoped it'd stick around for a few years, that maybe we'd release a couple of CDs and tapes and that we'd all move on with our lives. 

I had no idea that, 10 years later, I'd be sitting here with[3 LPs already out and a bunch more on the way.](https://analogrevolution.com/shop).

I had no idea that I'd have the honor of working with the one and only [Doctor Deathray](https://doctordeathray.bandcamp.com) to build what is absolutely the coolest fucking record label in the south east.

I had no idea that [our recording studio](https://ellijaymakerspace.org) would become the home for a huge part of GA's indie music scene. 

I had no idea that we'd still be booking concerts, that we'd be releasing new shows all the time on a [television network that we run out of a weird artists co-op](https://newellijay.tv) 

I guess what I'm saying is that I've gotten really lucky to be able to be a part of these things, and I'm eternally grateful for it.
