Thanks to my wonderful [patrons on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ajroach42) and the support the [Ellijay Makerspace](https://ellijaymakerspace.org), I have been able to procure some new equipment for making higher quality archival copies of 16mm films. Here's a demo of the equipment. As you'll see in the video, the contrast is better, the image is sharper, and the brightness is improved.

The new gear uses an Elmo projector, which has been bolted to a rig with a prism and an off the shelf 4k camcorder. I would not have expected this to produce good results, but I was wrong. It looks Wonderful. 

We're digitizing and upload 2 - 3 films a week on patreon, with 1 week of early access for patrons. Expect to see a lot more footage out of this gear in the coming weeks.
