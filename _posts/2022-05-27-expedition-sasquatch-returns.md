title: Expedition Sasquatch Returns
---
Did you know I write a podcast? It's a comedy podcast about Jack, a man who wants to find and kill bigfoot, and all the other cryptids he finds and kills instead. It has plasma guns, and ancient magicks, and mole people, and ro-men, and a racoon in the back of a Waffle House. 

It's called [Expedition Sasquatch](https://expeditionsasquatch.org) and you can find it at [ExpeditionSasquatch.org](https://expeditionsasquatch.org) or on [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9leHBlZGl0aW9uc2FzcXVhdGNoLm9yZy9lcGlzb2Rlcy5tNGEucnNz) or on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/expedition-sasquatch/id1470790931). If you really want, I can produce episodes that will fit on a floppy disk, and can be played back on a 486 DX2 or later CPU.

It stars my buddy Josh, with occasional contributions from me, and it's edited by [Connor Buchanan](https://connordylan.bandcamp.com/) among others. 

We release pretty irregularly, but we're producing new episodes, and embarking on new adventures now. It is the perfect time to catch up on our back catalog, and catch up on our latest episodes. 

And, if you're in the Ellijay area, we'll be doing a [live recording at the Gilmer Arts Playhouse on June 24.](https://analogrevolution.com/shows/)
