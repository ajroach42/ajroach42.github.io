title: 'Community Media: A Handbook for Revolutions in DIY TV'
---
This is the blueprint for a revolution in the creation and distribution of media. We will discuss how and why to produce your own television using free tools, and explore how to use Community Television as an instrument for social change.

This text is divided in to three sections: A [manual](https://communitymedia.network/manual/), a [meta-manual](https://communitymedia.network/what-now/https://communitymedia.network/what-now/), and [a look back](https://communitymedia.network/a-brief-history-of-diy-tv/). These can be consumed in any order.

This text takes a decidedly American approach to history and theory, and while I assume these ideas are applicable elsewhere, I do not have the expertise or knowledge to comment on any place other than the US.

I wrote a book. 

It is a work in progress. The text above adorns the first page of the current Zine copies of this book, which are available for sale. It clocks in around 100 pages, and those pages are complete and can stand alone. I am now working through additional supplements and further information, which will be shared on [Community Media Network](https://communitymedia.network), and made available as zines. 

When I feel like I've said what I need to say, I'll make it available in a more professionally bound package. 

In the meantime, [learn about the history of DIY Television, and how you can (and must!) make your own television today](https://communitymedia.network).
