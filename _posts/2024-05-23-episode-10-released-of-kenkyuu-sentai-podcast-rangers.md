I've been working on a podcast about Power Rangers and Super Sentai for a few months now, and I'm having a blast working on it. Episode ten is out now, and I think it's the best one we've released so far. If you'd like to listen to the audio version, you can [subscribe to Kenkyuu Sentai Podcast Rangers from New Ellijay Television](https://newellijay.tv/shows/kenkyuu-sentai-podcast-rangers-%e7%a0%94%e7%a9%b6-%e6%88%a6%e9%9a%8a-%e3%83%9d%e3%83%83%e3%83%89%e3%82%ad%e3%83%a3%e3%82%b9%e3%83%88-%e3%83%ac%e3%83%b3%e3%82%b8%e3%83%a3%e3%83%bc/). We post transcripts, but they're delayed by about two weeks. You can find [KSPR Transcripts on New Ellijay Television](https://newellijay.tv/category/transcript/). If you'd like to watch the video version, which is much better, it's embedded here:
