title: Some Surprise Expenses
published: False

Hi All! As I mentioned in my last post, we've had a couple of surprise expenses pop up in the first half of this year. The most prominent is that the remodel that turned our cafe in to a bookstore and cafe ended up over time and over budget by a fairly substantial amount, but that was just the start of what looks to be a string of bad luck. One of the A/C units at [our makerspace](https://ellijaymakerspace.org) failed, and it's going to cost upwards of $8k to replace, and then a series of bad thunderstorms (one of which produeced 4 tornadoes!) rocked our town, damaging lots of people's homes. We ended up with some substantial water damage which took out a portion of our wall and ceiling.
