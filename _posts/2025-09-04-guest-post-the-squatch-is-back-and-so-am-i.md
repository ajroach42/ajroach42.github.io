The Following is a Guest Post from Jackson QRST Sinclair, the acclaimed Cryptid Hunter, and star of the hit podcast [Expedition Sasquatch](https://ExpeditionSasquatch.org). (Yes, Jack is a fictional character that I write. Yes. This is just a blog post I wrote announcing the return of the Expedition Sasquatch podcast. If you're not a fan of my fiction, skip this one.) 

It’s been 19 months.

I know. I know. You thought maybe the Ro-Men finally got me. Or that I’d finally cornered Bigfoot and he’d put me through a wall (a worthy death, if you ask me). Or that I’d finally given up and taken a job at the Ellijay Piggly Wiggly.

None of the above! In fact, the Piggly Wiggly's been gone for nearly two decades. The truth is far less interesting. Life, as it has a habit of doing, got in the way. There were things to fix, bills to pay, and a husband (Skippy, of course) who insisted I “take a break for my health” after the whole… *Not-Deer incident*. I maintain that the venom was only mildly paralytic and that I recovered with nothing but a fierce determination and a newfound allergy to venison... Look, you'll have to wait until November to hear about that one, okay. 

But a man can only stack so many cans of beans in his basement before the itch returns. The itch to get back out there. To feel the crunch of unfamiliar leaves under your boots. To smell the distinct, musky aroma of a cryptid that *isn’t* your weird neighbor.

So, we’re back.

**[Expedition Sasquatch Episode 21: "Bugs 'n' Such" is out now.](https://expeditionsasquatch.org/2025/09/03/bugs-n-such.html#758a5645)**

It’s a good one. We’re dealing with something new. Something wing-ed. Something... Well, it's the goddamn mothman, okay. I hate him, you hate him, but he does lead us somewhere interesting. 

This is the first of *four* new episodes we’ve got locked and loaded for the rest of the year. The plan is to hit a monthly schedule for as long as humanly (or inhumanly) possible. We’re not messing around this time.

For our most dedicated Squatchers—the ones who’ve been keeping the lights on and the ammo stocked—there’s already another new episode available right now. You can find it:

*   On our **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ajroach42)**
*   Or for our **[NETV Sponsors](https://newellijay.tv/sponsor-us/)**

That one involves a sentient meat puddle. It's a real gross time. 

It’s good to be talking into the mic again. It’s good to be back in the woods. The truth is still out there, and it’s still ugly, poorly understood, and probably wants to eat us.

Let’s go find it.
