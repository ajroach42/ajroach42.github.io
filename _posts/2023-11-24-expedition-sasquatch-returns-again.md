title: 'EXPEDITION SASQUATCH RETURNS (Again!) '
---
Our Monthly/bi-weekly/quarterly/yearly podcast [Expedition Sasquatch](https://expeditionsasquatch.org) has just released a new episode! It's Episode Number 13. We've been producing this show since early 2019, and releasing episodes since June of 2019. That's an average of one episode every four months, although in reality it's actually 4 episodes in 2019, no episodes in 2020, 3 episodes in 2021, and 6 episodes of 2022. We're aiming to release an episode every two weeks for the forseeable future. Check it out:

Our podcast [Expedition Sasquatch](https://expeditionsasquatch.org). (Not our TV show [Expedition Sasquatch](https://vod.newellijay.tv/w/p/gZRM5o243CznqRojZDGNj2?playlistPosition=1&resume=true) which is a related but independent thing) is back!!! 

This episode was written and edited by me, and recorded by my good friend Josh Allen.  

Neither one of us has a real job anymore, and we're trying to make our living making weird media, (and tools for making weird media) and we'd really appreciate it if you'd help. 

Consider [sponsoring us](https://newellijay.tv/sponsor-us/) or [buy some of our merch](https://newellijay.tv/product/expedition-sasquatch-logo-t-shirt/) or just tell your friends about the show. Every little bit helps! 

## Synopsis

Jack is on the run from the FBI on account of two episodes ago. He makes a friend.
