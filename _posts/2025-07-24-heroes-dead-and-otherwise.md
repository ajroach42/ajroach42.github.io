title: 'Heroes, dead and otherwise'

Terry Gene Bollea, better known as "Hulk" Hogan, was by all acounts a racist pig, a supporter of Fascism, and an all around asshole. He was also one of my childhood heroes, and I'm far from alone in that. He's dead now, and I guess it is time to think about what it means to find out your heroes are monsters.
