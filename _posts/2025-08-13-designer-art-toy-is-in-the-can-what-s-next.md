Well, we survived the inagural **Designer Toy Art Fest**, and I’m still recovering. It was a whirlwind of incredible artists, late-nights, and the kind of creative energy that makes these shows worth the exhaustion.  

### **How We Did**  
We didn’t sell out, but we didn’t expect to. This was about **meeting people, sharing stories, and celebrating weird little toys**. Still, some highlights:  
- **Our soon to be released [*Jupiter’s Ghost* video game](https://ajroach42.itch.io/jupiters-ghost-away-mission-gbc)** was the surprise top seller (more on that soon!)  
- The **Super Squishy Monstrous Minis** were a hit. They’ll be up online next week for those who missed them  
- Plenty of folks picked up copies of ***The Mysterious Air Pirates*** magazine (still available [here](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/the-mysterious-air-pirates-volume-1-issue-1/))  

### **The Real Highlight: The People**  
The best part of any show is the community. We got to catch up with old friends, and make some new ones ([**Mr. Lobo** and **Sally the Zombie Cheerleader**](https://themonsterchannel.com/) were in fine form) and meet a ton of amazing artists. The creativity on display was humbling! There was so much talent packed into one room!

### **The Haul**  
Of course, I couldn’t leave without bringing home some treasures myself. Here’s a peek at some of the incredible work we picked up:

### **What’s Next?**  
Now that we’re back, it’s time to:  
- Pack up orders for **[Bart, Jacques, and Leyla](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product-tag/sky-pirates/)** (shipping starts this week!)  
- Get the Super Squishy **[Monstrous Minis](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product-tag/monstrous-minis/)** listed online  
- Start planning for the next adventure  

Huge thanks to everyone who stopped by, chatted, or took home a piece of our weird little world. These shows are exhausting, but they remind me why we do this: **the people, the art, and the joy of holding something strange and wonderful in your hands.**  

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need a nap.
