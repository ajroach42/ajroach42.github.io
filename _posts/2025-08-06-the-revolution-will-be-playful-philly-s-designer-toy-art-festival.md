title: 'The Revolution Will Be Playful: Philly''s Designer Toy Art Festival'
---

For the last six months, weâ€™ve been elbows-deep in melted plastic, failed molds, and the kind of stubborn optimism that keeps you going when your twentieth test shot comes out looking like modern art instead of an action figure. This weekend at the **Designer Toy Art Festival** in Philadelphia (August 9-10), weâ€™re finally unveiling what happens when you mix **revolutionary joy** with a whole lot of trial and error.  

### **What Weâ€™re Bringing**  
This isnâ€™t just a booth, itâ€™s the culmination of late nights, stubbornness, and the belief that **play matters**. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find:  

#### **The Toys We Learned to Make the Hard Way**  
Making these toys has been a hard fought battle. Every Sky Pirate, every monster, every space hero is a small victory against the idea that toys have to come from faceless factories.  

- **[Spacehawk](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/spacehawk-fun-size-heroes-coming-soon/)**: Our take on Basil Wolvertonâ€™s 1940s cosmic lawman, now in **3.75" of hand-painted rebellion**.  
- **[The Sky Pirates Crew](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product-tag/sky-pirates/)**: Jacques, Bart, Leyla: the outlaws we built from the ground up, one stubborn mold at a time. ([Meet Jacques](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/jacques-sky-pirate-fun-size-heroes-coming-soon/))  
- **[Monstrous Minis](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/monstrous-minis-keshi-2-pack/)**: Squishy, weird, and unapologetically handmade.  

#### **ðŸ“– The Stories That Started It All**  
The toys wouldnâ€™t exist without the stories that inspired them:  
- **[Mountain Town Comics #1-4](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product-category/comics/)**: Reprints of golden age classics, including *Spacehawk* and *Microface*.  
- **[The Mysterious Air Pirates #1](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/the-mysterious-air-pirates-volume-1-issue-1/)**: Our dime novel tribute to the kind of stories that used to be sold for a nickelâ€”and smuggled radical ideas into readersâ€™ hands.

### **Why?**  
This isnâ€™t about nostalgia! Itâ€™s about proving that **play can be rebellious**, that small batches beat soulless mass production, and that joy is its own kind of resistance. Every figure weâ€™re bringing to **[Designer Toy Art Fest](https://www.toyartfest.com/)** is a middle finger to the idea that creativity has to be corporate.  

So if youâ€™re in Philly this weekend, come say hi. Weâ€™ll have **early releases, festival deals, and maybe a story or two**.
