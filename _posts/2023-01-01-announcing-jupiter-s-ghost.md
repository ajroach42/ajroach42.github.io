Welcome to the new year! I'm glad you made the transfer without incident. It is my Duty and Privilege to announce the public launch of a [project](https://intergalactic.computer) I've been working on for the better part of a decade, This is [Jupiter's Ghost](https://intergalactic.computer/social/podcast/jupiters-ghost-episode-01-generation-mice/)! It is a podcast set in the [creative commons CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) licensed universe of the [Solar Federation](https://intergalactic.computer/social/about-jupiters-ghost-and-the-solar-federation/). It's a community initative, written and record by a small but growing group of contributors, which you are [formally invited to join](https://intergalactic.computer/social/how-to-contribute/)!
