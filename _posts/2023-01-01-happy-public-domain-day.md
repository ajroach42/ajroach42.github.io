title: Happy Public Domain Day
---
It's public domain day in the US. In celebration, I'll spend the next few weeks post about things that have recently entered the public domain, and about Public Domain Remix projects. To kick things off, here's a newly scored copy of the once-lost Laruel and Hardy picture "[The Battle of the Century](https://vod.newellijay.tv/w/qK49WdrPMcZbjxhhsDNv5m)" presented by [New Ellijay Television](https://newellijay.tv). 

<iframe title="The Battle of the Century (1927) - Laurel and Hardy" src="https://vod.newellijay.tv/videos/embed/c85e40f2-817c-4e91-ad42-3b58ec8165d0" allowfullscreen="" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>

We scored this using recordings from Archive.org's great 78 project, specifically recordings dated pre 1923, as those are currently in the public domain in the US. No new music entered the public domain this year, but we'll get yearly music drops starting next year for a while. 

Thanks to the UCLA film and television archive for the original restoration work circa 2015. 

Check back for more later.
