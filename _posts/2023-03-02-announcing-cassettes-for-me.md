title: Announcing Cassettes For Me
---
Just about ten years ago, I ran a [record store and little record label in Kennesaw, GA](https://analogrevolution.com). Back then, we wanted to do a monthly cassette club, with a new original album debuting every month, but we weren't able to pull it off. Recently, we've [revived the record label](https://analogrevolution.bandcamp.com) and we have a [Vinyl LP out in the next few weeks.](https://analogrevolution.bandcamp.com/album/giant-robot-jetpack-voted-most-chill-in-high-school), and the [Venerable Doctor Deathray](https://doctordeathray.bandcamp.com) has brought the project back to life, it's called [Cassettes For Me](https://cassettesfor.me) and our first tape starts shipping Friday March 3rd!

We're starting things off with a tape from our first [Put on a Show](https://ajroach42.com/put-on-a-show/) from the band Spirit's Republic. I've been listening to the thing on a loop and it's Wonderful, and I can't wait to share it with you all.
