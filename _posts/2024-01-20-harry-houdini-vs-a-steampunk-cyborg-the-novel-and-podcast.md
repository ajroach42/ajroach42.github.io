title: Harry Houdini vs A Steampunk Cyborg - The Novel and Podcast
---
I wrote a few weeks ago about [our efforts to digitize, score, and restore the 1918 science fiction cliffhanger serial The Master Mystery.](https://ajroach42.com/harry-houdini-vs-a-cyborg-in-the-master-mystery-1918/) That work continues, and as it does, we've found a few other, related items. Namely the novelization and a great audiobook of that novelization from Project Gutenburg and LibriVox. 

You can watch the episodes we've uploaded so far on [New Ellijay Television:](https://newellijay.tv)
