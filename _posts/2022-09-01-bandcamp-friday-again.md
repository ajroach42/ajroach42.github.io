title: Bandcamp Friday - Again
---
Friday, September 2nd, is Bandcamp Friday. That's the day that Bandcamp gives 100% of revenue to bands! I’m a big fan of DIY media, so I wanted to take a moment to recommend some new music on Bandcamp. This list is not comprehensive, these are just some things I’ve been jamming to latetly. [See this post for a much larger list from a previous bandcamp Friday](http://ajroach42.com/bandcamp-friday/)
