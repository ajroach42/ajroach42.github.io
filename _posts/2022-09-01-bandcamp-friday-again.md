title: Bandcamp Friday - Again
---
Friday, September 2nd, is Bandcamp Friday. That's the day that Bandcamp gives 100% of revenue to bands! I’m a big fan of DIY media, so I wanted to take a moment to recommend some new music on Bandcamp. This list is not comprehensive, these are just some things I’ve been jamming to latetly. [See this post for a much larger list from a previous bandcamp Friday](http://ajroach42.com/bandcamp-friday/)

# Giant Robot Jetpack 

## Hurly Burly and the Volcanic Fallout

"Giant Robots, Jetpack, Landsled, All of that. Let's Go." 

Hurly Burly and the Volcancic Fallout was formed while the members were in highschool. They recorded their first album in 2007, and toured in support of it (and subsequent records) between the five or six all ages venues in the metro-atlanta area for several years. 

They all went on to be musicians in other projects, many of which are very good.

Every few years, they've gotten back together and played a few shows or sometimes recorded a few songs. This is their first new music released in more than 10 years. 

They'll have an album, titled Giant Robot Jetpack, out before the end of the year. It's going to be a party. 

Recorded at the [Ellijay Makerspace](https://ellijaymakerspace.org) in April of 2022. 

# A Hundred Thousand Things

## Brett Schieber - featuring Calixte

Brett is one of the kindest people I've ever met, and he's also a tallented songwriter and performer. This release sees him playing in a Soul/Funk motif. It's new water for him, and I dig it. 


# Live 

## Doctor Deathray and her Implements of Destruction

Doctor Deathray is Violet. Her Implements of Destruction are The Goop, Sundog, and Dan. 

Violet has the most imposing precense of any musician I’ve ever known. She Commands every room she enters. Her guitar SCREAMS, and she terrifies me.

This is a live album she recorded in June at show hosted by [Analog Revolution](https://analogrevolution.com) and the [Ellijay Makerspace](https://ellijaymakerspace.org). It's explosive. 

Since the last Bandcamp Friday, Doctor Deathray (on her own this time) also released [Friday the 13th.](https://doctordeathray.bandcamp.com/album/friday-the-13th).

# Crypto 

## Michael Cera Palin

I met the members of MCP when they were in other bands, a long time ago. Now they are in this band (and many of them are also, still, in other bands). This band has proven to be 1) Astoundingly good, 2) Very Popular. 

This is their most recent single. It's about the horrors of fascists in the United States. 

They recorded it at the studio inside my [makerspace](https://ellijaymakerspace.org) (We're a popular studio, apparently) in May of 2022. 


# Coyote

## Small

They call it Fuckpunk, although I'm not sure how sincerely. I got to see them live at an Analog Revolution show in June, and it was great. One day, I might get to release the video from that show. (I am currently preventing myself from releasing the video, by way of having misplaced the SSD on which it resides.) 

# Others

I'm sure I missed a bunch. [Tell me about what music you buy on Bandcamp Friday](https://retro.social/@ajroach42) and I'll listen to it, and talk about my favorites next time.
