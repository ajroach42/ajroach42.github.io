Consider [this](https://MountainTown.FM) an experiment. 

That is to say, I'm starting an internet radio station, with the expressed intention of getting more music I like in to the ears of strangers on the internet and people in my home town. 

I dunno how long it will live, as long as people keep listening, I guess. 

I'm using Live365 for this. It's all properly licensed. There's a fair amount of actual independent local music in the rotation, I have direct permission from those artists to use their music.
