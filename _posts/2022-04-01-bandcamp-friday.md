It's Bandcamp Friday! That means bandcamp is giving 100% of revenue to bands! I'm a big fan of DIY media, so I wanted to take a moment to recommend some of my favorite albums on bandcamp. 



## [Andy's Song - Single from Pharmacy:](https://pharmacy21.bandcamp.com/track/andys-song)

Some of the most knowledgeable and genre savvy musicians working in Atlanta today, incredible pop/rock that you won't be able to get out of your head. 

## [Halfway Down - Album from Dinner Time:](https://dinner-time.bandcamp.com/album/halfway-down)

Is "Art Pop" still a thing? Jazz infused indie rock, with hazy vocals and slow tempos. 

### [Woo - Album by Floral Print:](https://floralprint.bandcamp.com/album/woo)

Vaguely mathy psychedelic stuff.

### [Sunset Honor Unit](https://shuatl.bandcamp.com/album/sunset-honor-unit)

In their own words "The turbopop bop operatives have arrived! SHU in your stereo, SHU in your system! Feel the vibrations and wade in the waters of total harmony!" 

### [Seasons Change - Single from Brett Schieber and Temi](https://brettschieber.bandcamp.com/album/seasons-change-my-summer-flame)

My buddy Brett is a great musician, and this new project sees him pairing with lots of different vocalists to do some soul tinged poppy stuff.


### [It's All Around - Eli Pop](https://elipopmusic.bandcamp.com/album/its-all-around)

Bedroom psych. Originally released by Burger Records on a limited cassette, now released by [Analog Revolution](https://analogrevolution.com) (New album out this year, on vinyl if we can get our shit together and do it.)

### ["The Loose Ends of Act 1" (2015​-​2020 Remastered)  - Michael Cera Palin ](https://michaelcerapalin.bandcamp.com/album/the-loose-ends-of-act-1-2015-2020-remastered)

Michael Cera Palin is one of my favorite bands, full stop. They do emo flavored pop punk, I guess? A lot of people compare them to American Football. 

If you know any of these recs outside of me, it's probably them. 

All of these songs are Astounding, and I'm so proud of these kids, even if they aren't kids anymore.


### [Voted Most Chill in high school - The New Clear Lawn Chairs](https://thenewclearlawnchairs.bandcamp.com/album/voted-most-chill-in-high-school)

It's the poppiest slop punk you'll listen to this month (with the bassist from MCP on lead guitar.) Available soon as a 7" from Analog Revolution. 

### [Cut it Out - The Scraps](https://thescrapsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/cut-it-out)

Livvie and co haven't recorded a song in 5 years or more? But this stuff was absolutely the soundtrack of my life in 2016. Dark, moody, grungy music made by teenagers. Highlights include After Party and Chicago.

### [The boygirlfriends](https://theboygirlfriends.bandcamp.com/)

Indie pop from a bunch of classically trained musicians and also Jon from The New Clear Lawn Chairs.

### [Oat Milk:](https://oatmilkmusic.bandcamp.com/)

Jazz-y pop from some classically trained musicians. Go listen to Bubble Tea for Breakfast. 

### [Think About It - Rod Hamdallah:](https://rodhamdallah.bandcamp.com/album/think-about-it-ep)

Blues Rock, in the style of The Black Keys pre El Camino. Rod's a master.

### [Local Honey - The Big Heed https://thebigheed.bandcamp.com/album/local-honey

I can't really describe The Big Heed in words that make sense. I've known one of their guitarists/vocalists for a long time, and she's one of the most talented musicians I've ever met. 

She does very garage-y things. 

The rest of the band is doing less garage-y, more psych-funk things. 

The combination is a garage/psych/funk party that I am happy to attend. 

Try the tracks Fire and Local Honey.

### [Letters From Nowhere - Doctor Deathray](https://doctordeathray.bandcamp.com/album/letters-from-nowhere-vol-1?label=1708079041&tab=music)

Doctor Deathray is Violet, The Goop, Sundog, and Taxdan. Violet has the most imposing precense of any musician I've ever known. She Commands every room she enters. Her guitar SCREAMS, and she terrifies me. 

### [Our Retirement Plan is Revolution - Color Dylan](https://connordylan.bandcamp.com/track/our-retirement-plan-is-revolution-rough-mix?label=1708079041&tab=music)

Connor wrote and recorded this song at [The Ellijay Makerspace](https://ellijaymakerspace.org) in about two hours. Somehow, it manages to be good in spite of that. 

### [Dust to Digital](https://dusttodigital.bandcamp.com/music)

Dust to Digital does historical archiving work, and it's Wonderful. Here's [a write up bandcamp did about them](https://daily.bandcamp.com/label-profile/dust-to-digital-label-profile)

Here's [my favorite release of theirs](https://dusttodigital.bandcamp.com/track/there-s-nothing-to-be-ashamed-of).

Pen Ran - There’s Nothing To Be Ashamed Of
from Don’t Think I’ve Forgotten: Cambodia’s Lost Rock and Roll 

That whole album is full of absolutely Smoking guitar work.

There's also [this collection of 45 RPM records from Morocco](https://dusttodigital.bandcamp.com/album/kassidat-raw-45s-from-morocco) which both whips and slaps.

And then there's [Just Before Music.](https://dusttodigital.bandcamp.com/album/just-before-music)

This is a 2012 release of all new material, which is out of character for Dust to Digital. 

The washington post called it: "a free jazz fever dream from the deep South, a babbling Baptist sermon from deep space, a lullaby for the end of the world, a songbook that’s frequently beautiful and occasionally frightening.

it's by  Lonnie Holley, a black sculptor, painter, and musician born in Alabama in 1950. 

It's required listening.

### [Songs of the Workers (to Fan The Flames of Discontent)](https://analogrevolution.bandcamp.com/album/songs-of-the-worker-to-fan-the-flames-of-discontent)

You can also pre-order Analog Revolution's upcoming comp Songs of the Workers (to fan the flames of discontent)

The final release should be out this summer, and will be 12 tracks, most of which will be radical (and a few of which will also be tubular.)
