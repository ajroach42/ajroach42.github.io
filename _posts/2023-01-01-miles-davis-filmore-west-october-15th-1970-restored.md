title: Miles Davis - Filmore West - October 15th 1970 - RESTORED!
---
In 2017, I wrote about [this concert Miles Davis played](https://ajroach42.com/miles-davis-fillmore-west-october-15th-1970/). It is one of my favorite performances from my aboslute favorite lineup of Miles' career. In that original post I said "thereâ€™s an annoying voiceover that was unintentionally included around the 15 minute mark that mars the quality of this otherwise stellar recording, just as the band is really getting in to the zone." At the time, this was true. It ain't true anymore. Click through, and listen to this newly restored version.

I know "AI" enhancement can be controversial, and I wouldn't for a second claim that this is a better Archival copy than the original, but it's certainly my preferred listening copy.
