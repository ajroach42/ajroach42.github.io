title: Announcing 研究 戦隊 ポッドキャスト レンジャー  - Kenkyuu Sentai Podcast Rangers
---
As part of my [quest to make a living producing media, archiving media, and building tools to produce and archive media](https://ajroach42.com/producing-and-archiving-media/) I'm proud to announce a new show! _研究 戦隊 ポッドキャスト レンジャー_  or _Kenkyuu Sentai Podcast Rangers_ is a twice monthly podcast featuring myself, my oldest friend, and a rotating cast of supporting anchors, discussing Super Sentai, Power Rangers, and the process of turning one in to the other. The first episode is out now. 

You can [find the podcast on New Ellijay Television](https://newellijay.tv/podcast/was-there-like-other-trash-in-that-space-dumpster-alien-trash/) and you can [subscribe to it via RSS](https://newellijay.tv/feed/podcast) or [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6-%E6%88%A6%E9%9A%8A-%E3%83%9D%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88-%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A3%E3%83%BC-kenkyuu-sentai-podcast-rangers/id1718967293).

_Usually, I would also include links to Google Podcasts and Spotify, but I won't be doing that anymore for reasons I'll get to in a later blog post, probably. In the meantime, you can probably guess what kind of shenanigans are ongoing. If you don't own your platform it will be stolen from you. Subscribe via RSS directly, for either the audio or the video, if you want to keep up with what we're doing._

## Why?

So, first and foremost, why am I making a podcast about Power Rangers? It started when my oldest friend posted on the only worthwhile social media platform that, if he had infinite money and mental health resources, he'd do a deep dive podcast into power rangers and super sentai in the same way that The Great Gundam Podcast does a deep dive into Gundam.

(It is important for me to note at this time that you probably shouldn't go follow him as a result of this. He doesn't want new followers. [Go follow the show instead](https://meet.communitymedia.network/@kenkyuusentaipodcastrangers).) 

I don't have unlimited financial or mental health resources, but I do have a [makerspace](https://ellijaymakerspace.org), it's associated [Television Network](https://newellijay.tv), and [Big Feels about Community Media](https://communitymedia.network). [I also have, as I recently mentioned, dedicated my days to producing media](https://ajroach42.com/producing-and-archiving-media/), so I decided not to wait for a hypothetical future
