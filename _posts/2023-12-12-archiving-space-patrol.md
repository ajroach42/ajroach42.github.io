title: Archiving Space Patrol
---
I spend a lot of time and energy digitizing and cataloging episodes of Space Patrol (1950), and I haven't talked about that much recently, so I'm going to talk about that today. Space Patrol was an American science fiction Space Adventure television program that aired from 1950 to 1955. For most of it's run, it aired 6 days a week, producing a 15 minute episode every weekday in the tradition of the soap opera (or I suppose, the Space Opera), and a half hour episode every Saturday. It aired 52 weeks a year, producing more than a thousand episodes of television (in addition to several hundred episodes of the Radio Program!) All of these episodes were produced Live, with little rehersal, and broadcast live out to the world. Video tape would not enter in to common use until 5 years after the show went off the air. 

They were [Kinescoped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinescope) for re-broadcast on the east coast, and for future re-runs, but most of the 15 minute daily episodes and many of the half hour weekly episodes are lost, and there has been no officially sanctioned release of any episodes of the show, although various purveyors of DVD-Rs have released collections of wildly varying quality and completion, and Kinescopes appear on the secondhand market with some frequency. 

I have personally digitized dozens of episodes of the show from the original film elements, including many episodes of the half hour show. I have additionally undertaken an effort to digitize various semi-official and unofficial VHS tapes and DVD releases that I have picked up from conventions, video stores, and online fan communities. 

My ultimate goal is to build the definitive collection of the show, identifying which episodes exist, and which ones are still missing, and pointing to the best available sources for the episodes which survive. I have a long way to go, but as I work I am sharing the episodes we digitize with [New Ellijay Television](https://newellijay.tv).
