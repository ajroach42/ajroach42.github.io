title: Put on a Show
---
We do a regular concert series at the [Gilmer County Playhouse](https://gilmerarts.com) and the [Ellijay Makerspace](https://ellijaymakerspace.org). We film them for [New Ellijay Television](https://newellijay.tv), and you can [watch them online](https://vod.newellijay.tv/w/p/rM6MT9F7CRdAXvzLg8zui9). It's the one year anniversary of our first show, and to celebrate we're releasing a [cassette tape of one of the sets from the first show](https://cassettesfor.me/and-the-first-cassette-headed-your-way-is/) through [CassettesFor.Me](https://cassettesfor.me). Watch the show here:
