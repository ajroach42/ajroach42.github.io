title: 'PROJECT LAUNCHES - SKY PIRATES, SPACE HEROES, AND REVOLUTIONARY JOY'

It’s been a whirlwind few months here at New Ellijay Heavy Industries, and I’m thrilled to finally share what we’ve been working on. This weekend at the [**Designer Toy Art Festival** in Philadelphia (August 9-10)](https://www.toyartfest.com/about), we’re launching not just one project, but an entire ecosystem of interconnected stories and toys—all rooted in my love of **pulp history, radical storytelling, and handcrafted design.**  

### **The Mysterious Air Pirates #1 – A Dime Novel for the Disillusioned**  
The flagship of this new era is [*The Mysterious Air Pirates* #1](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/the-mysterious-air-pirates-volume-1-issue-1/), a **quarterly story paper** in the tradition of early 20th-century dime novels. This isn’t a pastiche—it’s a direct continuation of the kind of stories that used to be sold on newsstands for a nickel.  

- **Inspired by [the 1915 film *Filibus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Filibus_1915.webm)** (but with the crew fleshed out and a lot more worker solidarity)  
- **Handmade design** I did the collage cover, typography, and layout myself, using period-accurate fonts and aesthetics  
- **Printed on uncoated, cheap stock** on tabloid sized paper to *feel* like an artifact  
- **Quarterly releases** (August, November, February, May)

The story follows a **genderqueer sky pirate captain** and their crew of outcasts. It’s full of heists, airship battles, and **revolutionary joy**—the idea that resistance shouldn’t just be necessary, but *exhilarating*.  

### **Sky Pirate Toys – Small-Batch Rebellion**  
Alongside the comic, we’re debuting the first of our **3.75" Sky Pirate action figures**, starting with [**Jacques**, the French-Canadian rogue](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/jacques-sky-pirate-fun-size-heroes-coming-soon/). These aren’t mass-produced plastic—they’re:  

- **Made from [PAL](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/pal-toy-1lb-white/)**, a PVC-free, non-toxic vinyl substitute that was custom engineered for us, to produce toys that are like the vintage toys your remember, but without the chlorine gas.
- **Hand-painted in Ellijay, GA** (no two are exactly alike)  
- **Designed to feel like lost ’70s toys** (think Kenner Star Wars or Mego super hero figures)  

More pirates are coming with each quarterly issue, and they'll just keep getting better.

### **Spacehawk & Mountain Town Comics #3**  
For fans of **Basil Wolverton’s golden age comics**, we’ve got two treats:  

1. **[A 3.75" Spacehawk action figure](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/spacehawk-fun-size-heroes-coming-soon/)**—based on his 1940-1942 *Target Comics* and *Blue Bolt Comics* appearances. Fully articulated, with a removable belt and grappling hook.  
2. **[Mountain Town Comics #3](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/mountain-town-comics-issue-3-spacehawk-and-microface/)**, featuring:  
   - A classic **Spacehawk story** (Wolverton at his pulpy best)  
   - Al Ulmer’s bizarre **Microface** tale (a vigilante with a gadget-filled mask)

### **But Why?**  
This isn’t just nostalgia. It’s about **reclaiming the revolutionary spirit of a bygone era**, when stories were cheap, wild, and unafraid to be as naturally political as real life. When toys were made by small teams, not corporations. When genderfluid sky pirates slipped into mainstream films because no one had bothered to censor them yet.  

### **Come See Us in Philly!**
