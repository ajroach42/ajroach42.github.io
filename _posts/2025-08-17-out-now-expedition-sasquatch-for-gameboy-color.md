[Expedition Sasquatch](https://expeditionsasquatch.org) is Now a [Game Boy Color Game](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/expedition-sasquatch-the-game-gbc-cartridge/)!

Bigfoot hunter Jack is back—and this time, he’s in your Game Boy Color. Based on the hit comedy podcast [Expedition Sasquatch](https://expeditionsasquatch.org), this retro-styled adventure drops you into Jack’s world of bizarre encounters, strange creatures, and mysteries that are way weirder than anything he set out to find.

Explore dense forests, wander into a curiously out-of-place city, and meet a cast of odd characters, all while hunting for clues (and, okay, maybe something resembling a Sasquatch). With classic 8-bit visuals, chiptune music, and the same offbeat humor as the podcast, it’s a love letter to both handheld gaming and Jack’s uniquely terrible expedition skills.

The game is available now as a [physical cartridge](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/expedition-sasquatch-the-game-gbc-cartridge/), so if you’ve ever wanted to experience Jack’s misadventures in pixel form, here’s your chance.

[Pick up your copy here](https://www.mountaintowntoys.com/product/expedition-sasquatch-the-game-gbc-cartridge/)!

The game was developed by [Andrew Roach](https://impractical.computer) (That's me!) and [Elvies](https://elvies.itch.io/) If you're interested in a ROM, drop me a message on Mastodon. If enough folks reach out, I'll stick one up on itch PWYW.

And if you’re new to Expedition Sasquatch, you can [dive into the podcast at expeditionsasquatch.org](https://expeditionsasquatch.org). Happy hunting! (Or, more likely, happy getting hopelessly sidetracked.)
