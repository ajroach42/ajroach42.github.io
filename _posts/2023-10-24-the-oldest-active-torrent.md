title: The Oldest Active Torrent
---
If there are two things I'm known for, probably, it's talking about [independent media production](https://communitymedia.network) and [media archival](https://ajroach42.com/document-your-art-how-to-archive/). My story today comes from the confluence of both. The [oldest continually seeded torrent just turned 20 years old](https://torrentfreak.com/the-worlds-oldest-active-torrent-turns-20-years-old-230924/), and it is a matrix fan film. Watch: 

> "THE FANIMATRIX: RUN PROGRAM" - a New Zealand fan film set in "The Matrix" universe which was released in 2003.

> Shot for only $500US, it was featured prominently on Slashdot.org, garnering the film's website with nearly 3 million hits during the first 5 days (with 70,000 downloads in that same period), and is also remembered for being an early contributor to the popularity of the BitTorrent file-distribution system.

> With an estimated 5 million downloads since 2003, it is arguably New Zealand's most widely seen short film and one of the most popular Matrix fan films to date.

I heard about the film when it was released, but our home internet at the time was not fast enough or consistently available enough to watch it. I had forgotten about it entirely until earlier today when someone uploaded it to our new [Community Media peertube server](https://communitymedia.video).

With the [grim future of youtube](https://ajroach42.com/the-grim-future-of-youtube/), it's almost heartwarming to see something that has been kept alive on the internet independently for more than 20 years. 

I'm working on a longer piece about fan films, transnational adaptations, and modern folklore. The Fanimatrix will slip right in to that piece, but in the meantime, I thought it was worth sharing here.
