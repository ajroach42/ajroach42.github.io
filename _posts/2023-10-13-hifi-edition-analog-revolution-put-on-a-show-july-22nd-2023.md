title: 'Hifi Edition - Analog Revolution Put on a Show - July 22nd, 2023 '
---
Back in July, I shared [a post about the lofi edition of our July concert at the Gilmer Arts Playhouse](https://ajroach42.com/your-filename/). Today, I'm sharing the Hi-Fi edition. This is the first show we've produced in 4k, and the first of our playhouse shows to feature videographer Nelson Crawford (of John Thefruitman and Holders.) I think the results speak for themselves, and I'm incredibly proud to have been a part of this.

[Rat Babies'](https://ratbabies.bandcamp.com/album/live-from-ellijay) set from this show is currently available on [cassete](https://analogrevolution.com/product/rat-babies-live-from-ellijay-cassette/) and [CD](https://analogrevolution.com/product/rat-babies-live-from-ellijay-cd/) from our record label, [Analog Revolution](https://analogrevolution.com/rat-babies-live-from-ellijay/). 

Other featured artists include [Piece](https://piecebewithyou.bandcamp.com/album/piece-be-with-you), and [Doctor Deathray](https://doctordeathray.bandcamp.com/album/51-miles-from-nowhere). The show is a mishmash of doomy, sludgey, loud metal; grunge tinged, computerized emo; and blistering blues rock.

This is part of our regular concert series for [New Ellijay Television](https://newellijay.tv).
